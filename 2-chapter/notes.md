# Object Oriented Programming

Well, the reason to explain this concept right now, is because Java is fully Object Oriented Programming, which means that to write programs using java as programming language requires us to do it using this technique or style of programming. So let's start by learning some important concepts of OOP. In this style of programming everthing are entities which interacts with each other and as result of this interaction your computer does something... for example:
 There is an entity in charge of reading a file from your hard drive (Your computer storage device), and after reading this file the entity interacts with another entity whicn sends this file over the internet.

> **Note** Not the most accuarate example but just to give you an idea.

## Classes
Classes are where it all starts, classes are receips to create the entities I mentioned previously, these entities cannot exists by theme selves, **Java** must know what are the __*features*__ of each one of this entities, which actions (**_interactions_**) can be performed by this entities, a simple example of the receipt for the file reader could be: 
```
# Features: 
- File to read

# Actions:
- Read the file

```

### Objects
As mentioned previously, java is fully Object Oriented, and classes are the receipts to create objects, the creation of an object could be the equivalent of following a receipt to bake a cake, you follow the instructions as result you have a baked cake, to eat it or just to exhibit... We do not create Objects, we just tell java when to create them and how many of them to create, and also java does not put this objects to interact with each other, as programmers we tell java how and when this objects will interact with eachother.

> **Note** The creation of this objects is called **Instantiate**, **Instantiation** or **Create an instance of**, from now on when we need to tell **Java** to create an object from some class, I'll just mention: **let's add an instance of**.

### Attributes
I mentioned previously that we need to specify java what are the **Features** or characteristics that the objects we want java to create should have, this specification should be into a receipt (**Class**), these features are known in object oriented programming as **Attributes**, this attributes could be: **Private**, **Protected** or **Public** (by default public), don't worry, I'll explain more about this later.

### Methdos
Also, we can specify **Java** which **Actions** an object can use to interact with other objects (Or with it self), this **Actions** are known in Object Oriented Programming as: **Methods**, also a method could be **Private**, **Protected** or **Public**, but also a method could **Return** something or not, we will talk about this later.
