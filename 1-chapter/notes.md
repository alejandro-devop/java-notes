# What is java?

Is a programming language based on the [Object Oriented paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), one of the main reasons it is so popular is because allows to build cross platform applications, which means developers can write applications which runs on Mac, Windows, Linux and others without rewriting their code. you can learn more about java [here.](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html)

## Concepts to know before getting started
Before getting our hands dirty with code, there are some important concepts we all need to know (in case you never code before), some of them are concepts which apply to any other programming languages.

1. [Data](#data)
2. [Data types](#data-types)
3. [Sentences](#sentences)
4. [Operators](#operators)
5. [Variables](#variables)
6. [Declarations](#declarations)
7. [Blocks](#blocks)
8. [Key words](#key-words-reserved-word)

### Data
In most cases programming is about data manipulation, gathering data, analyzing data, storing data, sharing data or making calculations with data. If you think of it when you're sending a text message you are sharing text throughout internet. In programming we classify this data into different categories or `types`

---

### Data types
#### Integers (int)
Any data that is a numeric value without decimal point is considered an _**Integer**_, for example an age (24), a year (2003) and so on.
> **Note** Of course, if you already are a developer you'll know is more complex than this, but, let's leave it this way for now )

#### Floats (float)
Any data that is a numeric value with decimal point is considered a _**float**_, an example of a float could be `20.3`

#### Strings
Strings are characters sequences, and when we say characters we mean alphanumeric symbols like we humans use to communicate (letters). Usually in most programming languages we can identify a String because they are always surrounded by a symbol, in most cases a double coute `"`, an example of a string can be: `"Alberto del Rio"`
>  **Note** Spaces are considered also a character

#### Booleans (bool)
Here it can get a little more complex... or not... Booleans a the representation of two natural states... _On_ or _Off_... in programming we refer to booleans as something that can be `true` or `false`. For now is all you need to know about booleans.

We will see more data types as we go through the notes.

### Sentences
Maybe you've been hearing that computers aren't that smart... And it's true, computers can't execute tasks by them selves unless someone tell them to, unless someone gives them _**instructions**_ to be executed. In programming we call this instructions as _**sentences**_, and a software or an application is nothing more than a set of _**sentences**_ telling the computer what to do and when to do it. In the case of graphical applications this instructions can precisely describe where the buttons and text inputs are located in the screen and what will happen when the user interacts with them. In java we have one rule with these sentences, and is that all sentences must end with semicolon symbol `;`

---

### Operators
In programming we know as _**operator**_ to a character witch executes an specific action, for example, we got an operator to indicate our computer that a Mathematic addition must be executed `+`, with this symbol we are telling to the computer that two numbers must be operated in addition, for example: `12 + 3`, the result of this operation will be `15`. There more _**operators**_ we'll be learning as we go on.

---

### Variables
In the programming world variables are just a storage or containers. What do they contain? data, information, which could be numbers, letters (as we mentioned before), symbols or even the result of arithmetic operations (what we will be doing later). but don't worry, not everyting in programming is about math...

---

### Declarations
Ok, let's combine five concepts: **Data types**,**Variables**, **Operators**, **data** and **Sentences**: 
The following is an example of a **sentence** used to indicate to the computer that a **variable** named `myAge` should be created, the **type of data** which will be stored in this variable is an _Integer_, and the **Data** stored into the variable is `30` (which is an Integer), the **Operator** `=` is used to indicate the action of storing this value, and as you can see, the sentence is finished using the `;` (semicolon) character. 
```java
int myAge = 30;
```
---

### Blocks
Blocks are no difficult to learn, they are just how we group sentences, there are different reasons to group sentences in programming and we will see them later, but for now what you need to know is that blocks starts with the symbol `{` (opening curly braces) and ends with the symbol `}` (closing curly braces)

---

### Key words (Reserved word)

Key words are words that a programming language associates to specific actions, operations or definitions for it's own work, don't worry if you don't understand right now, for now you just need to know that key words are something special and somethings do something special, we'll talk about this later.

---

### Program or application

As previously mentioned a program is a set of instructions to tell the computer what to do. Usually this instructions are stored in files with an special extension (Depending on the language), for example: `MyApp.java` for java case, `myApp.js` for Javascript, `my_app.py` for python, `myApp.cpp` for C++ and so on.

### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Well, this is a little complex to explain right now, but, is mentioned above, programs or applications (Software in general), are a set of instructions, Object Oriented Programming is a way of writing this programs, we can called a technique of codeing, there are a lot of other techniques and patters for creating a program, for esample: [structured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming), [Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), [POO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), etc. _(click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) to see more)_
